# Sig Fig and Error Propagation Calculator
## Significance
Significant Figures, or sig figs, are scientifically accurate way to present and display measurements in a meaningful way. Sig figs are normally determined by applying the rules addative/subtractive and multiplicative/division significance. However, in the case of higher level analytical chemistry or physics, sig figs are no longer a standalone reference but instead become defined by the uncertainty of a given measurement. Similar to the rules regarding addative/subtractive and multiplicative/division significance there are also equations for propagating uncertainty through similar calculations as well as logarithmic and exponential ones. 
The following Sig fig calculator looks to provide users with the ability to intutively define formulas and then plug in values to calculate the propogation of uncertainty at the click of a button.
